PG110607A:

	Initial archive. I am still not sure whether I will spend any time on
	this, but it doesn't hurt to start.

	The initial archive, to the best of my memory, is the original version
	2.2 + a simple modification in ex.c (look for PGPGPG) disabling the
	security check inhibiting split.

PG110607B:

	Changed FT_FILE (an enum item) in guix11 to FT_ZFILE (it collided with
	some fonts-related includes).

	Eliminated superfluous (and erroneous) attempts to internally expand
	file names appearing as call arguments.

	SA_INTERRUPT is not defined under Cygwin, which was causing compilation
	errors.

	Fixed configure to use curses (instead of termcap) with Cygwin.

	Fixed Makefile.in to remove ctags on clean.

	My version of elvis.x11 moved to data/ and made official. A couple of
	other (suggested) files added there as well.
